                      Hi! I'm a lightweight rower and wannabe Canadian who enjoys spending my free time terrorizing J-1 in a pikachu onesie. I enjoy music, art, running, and making it my mission to kick ass, go to space, and represent the human race.

                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      I love the quirkiness and the genuine support and care that everyone shows for each other here. Whenever I'm having a bad day or need help with something, my entry is always there to make it better.

                    <p>
                      Hello! I'm a senior in J entry. It's a fabulous place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I'm a lounge dweller - you'll find me hanging out in the main lounge procrastinating or studying (50-50). You may also find me tinkering in my room with my 3D printer. If you need anything fixed, I have tools! :) I also go to class haha.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I'm always happy to talk and down for a board game or a game of pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Other cool thing - I've sailed across the Atlantic Ocean

                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      J entry is a place to relax and unwind after a long drink from the firehose, a good place to get work done while around friends, a place where spontaneous music parties (think the trollolol song) and a place where you'll find people who will take care of you and look out for you. Everyone is friendly and social - social meaning we like talking to friends and leaving our doors open and going to study breaks -- we don't throw parties involving substances or loud music, though we do have spontaneous reenactments of Star Wars lightsaber fights

                      <p>
                        I'm Caity, a freshman most likely majoring in Course 8 or something related to physics. I am from a suburban town outside of Philadelphia, PA and insist that there is nothing better than a good cheese steak. I apparently have an accent, so don't worry if you hear me saying words like "bad" and "water" in a funny way. I am also a fan of water ice and hoagies aka Italian ice and subs for all of you non-Philly folk. I love the movie frozen and will often be found wandering around wearing Olaf pajamas.

                      <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                      <p>
                        J Entry is more than just a home away from home. When you have a bad day and feel like crying, there's always someone here talk to and a shoulder to cry on. When you're really hyper and happy, everyone else is also really happy and hyper with you. Being a close-knit family, we also tend to spend a lot of time PSetting with each other in the lounge. J is a collection of fun, interesting, unique, and inspiring individuals. I love every minute I spend with the people in J, and I'm so happy that I was fortunate enough to be in this entry. After walking back from campus at the end of a long day, my favorite thing to do is to look into the J main lounge and see everyone hanging out and cracking up. It truly is the highlight of every day.

He has a strong interest in chemistry and the other natural sciences, and appreciates odd puns, stoic wit, and dark humor. The only thing he likes more than sarcasm is writing about himself in the third person.

                      Hi! I'm David AKA "Brit number two". I am J's resident exchange student from the other Cambridge. I am the host of the J1 cooking show "Cooking with David" and I enjoy Doctor Who, fun times, and sleeping. I'm enjoying exploring the New England area before returning to the original England. You can find in the main lounge at all times, usually psetting, or avoiding psetting.

                    <p>
                      Hi
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I am a sophomore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I like pop-tarts, memes, and Arizona Black and White Tea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Outside of these, I enjoy things such as Star Wars, Back to the Future, Pixar stuff, Civilization, GTA, Skyrim, Mass Effect, KotOR, Apocalypse Rising, Star Trek, Spongebob, and a lot of other stuff. For a full list of my interests, please contact me at epw@mit.edu.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In my free time (procrastination time), I'll watch TeenNick while laying on my futon, bum around Boston, take a walk to McDonald's, or do some indie game development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is possible (however unlikely) that I will occasionally go overboard on my love for Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Don't worry, though; this is primarily a ploy to get on Jonathan's nerves (check him out if you haven't, already. 10/10 would recommend).
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      J is the best. It's obviously difficult to summarize why, but I'll attempt to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When I participated in in-house rush, many entries wowed me with their quirks, food, and conversation. J Entry, however, provided me with a little more. I made real connections, and was able to be completely myself without feeling whatsoever out of place. I could tell from the start that I would make great friends here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We play video games, watch movies, troll each other (if you need trolling lessons just come over to J2 and ask for Kevin), eat food, walk around Boston, playfully debate, make art, and meme together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This obviously isn't a complete list. But whether you need an exercise partner, a debate about austerity measures in Greece, pop-tarts, movie and music suggestions, someone to go on late night adventures with you, or some spare paperclips to bind a pset together, you can find it in J.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And that's a beautiful thing.

                    <p>
                      Hello.  I currently reside on J3 and am the Packers fan who will occasionally shout at his computer on Sundays.  Other than with football, I'm a calm person who enjoys spending my free time running next to the Charles river, listening to podcasts, and/or trying to get another pset done.  Around MIT, I'm a member of Cru and a cadet in Air Force ROTC Detachment 365.

                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      Living in J Entry is more than I could have hoped for in a college experience.  Not only do I get to live among freshman as we work through GIRs and adapting to college life, but I also get to interact with upperclassmen and hear of their interesting experiences and sage advice.  Together, all of these kind, fun, intelligent, and unique people make a community.  I think that sense of community is well captured by J Entry dining hall dinners.  We try to eat as a group, and I often look forward to hearing about the interesting stories and opinions of everybody.  J Entry is home.

                      A course 14 pretentious tryhard from northern Michigan. I spend most of my free time chilling around J Entry, at Hayden Library or listening to hipster trash (e.g. indie rock, experimental electronic, and hip hop). Sometimes I play Civilization and then remember how bad I am at it and stop.

                      J Entry is a cool, caring community (but not in a cheesy 70's sitcom kind of way); your friends here will always look out for you. It's a great group of people from diverse interests and backgrounds, and we've also got a (relatively) laid-back culture. Also sometimes we go to IHOP at 2AM which is excellent.

                      Hey, its nice to meet youse guys. My name is Jonathan and I'm from the wonderful city of Philadelphia. I'm really fascinated by how materials limit our technological world. Why try to come up with a clever contraption when really what’s standing in your way is the need for nickel based super alloys for turbine or rocket engines, gallium arsenide based semiconductors for high frequency computing, or samarium-cobalt magnets for fusion powered tokamaks. I also have an eye to the sky because this rock that we seem to have started on, I think, is just the beginning. Stick around and I would be delighted to have a chat with you.

                      J-Entry is easy going, approachable, and fun. We are all pretty low key people that you can see yourself playing your favorite game with, watching a movie, or maybe even knocking out a few problem sets. We're like Jello, but please, only the green kind, not the red, the red is just nasty I honestly cant figure out why people even serve that chaff to people these days. Anyways, like Jello, we bounce around while remaining a relatively comfortable, consistent facet of your residential life.

                      Joyce is your not-self-proclaimed (I swear) guru of indie or roguelike games such as Crypt of the Necrodancer and The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth. She also does occasionally hype about other worthy video games such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and more! Feel free to start a conversation at your own risk. (You'll either be judged or praised for your plebeian tastes.) Other keywords that may be associated with Joyce are: 'art', 'salt', 'puns', and sometimes, 'DIOOO'.

                      Hello! My name is Kevin and I live on J2. I am one of J Entry's social chairs, so it's my job to make sure that you have ample opportunity to meet people and get exposed to all the shenanigans of the entry. I hail from New Jersey and love things that go fast. I work on the Formula SAE team at MIT and take cars very seriously. I'm one of J2's insomniacs and you can always find me in my room at 3AM (sometimes working, sometimes just watching racecar videos (because racecar)). I also really enjoy riding my road bike with others when there isn't 3 feet of snow on the ground.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      J entry is all about people. I think that the combination of characters that we have in the entry is truly unique and is endlessly entertaining. The sense of camaraderie in the entry is really the distinguishing factor of J entry and not every living group on campus has the same dynamic.

                    <p>
                      I was basically adopted by J entry my junior year, after forming a p-set group with a couple residents. I was amazed at how welcoming and friendly the entry is and how quickly I became friends with anybody new I met while working in the lounge. Soon enough it was obvious that I should move in with all of my favorite people, so I could stop walking over freezing in my pajamas to play Pokemon at 2am instead. J entry is the most caring and supportive community I've encountered at MIT, and if you're facing a tough week you can be certain there are friends here who will cheer you up, help you out, and maybe even surprise you with late-night chocolate cake. And that's not to mention all the shenanigans we get up to involving bad puns, worse trolls, and spontaneous adventures. It's home!

                      Hi. I'm very indecisive about my major, but I like Chemistry and batteries, although I don't know enough about either to really say I like them. I think I want to be an engineer, but I haven't built anything ever, so yeah...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So that I don't have to think about my lack of concrete goals and aspirations, I keep myself very busy. Besides going to school, I also dive on the Varsity Diving Team, volunteer as a tutor for local school kids, and work as an alumni caller (Tech Caller) to fundraise for MIT. Even though I'm not around the entry that much, I think I contribute to its welcoming environment through the signs on my door that greet anyone entering J3. Some features are Black Science Man, portal unicorn, and Meet the Robinsons.

                    <p>
                      J is my home away from home. We really are a family here. If you have a bad day, someone is always willing to talk with you or brood with you, whichever fits your mood. If you have a good day, you bet someone will dance around in glee with you. Staying up past three doing psets is not advised, but when you have your fellow jenizens to keep you company, it's not that bad.

                      So this might sound cheesy and/or it might be said a lot, but J-entry is really my home away from home. The residents really are my surrogate family, and in many cases, even more awesome than my ""actual"" family, but shhh don't tell them I said that ;p
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I love that J is such a community and on any given afternoon/evening there are usually at least a couple people hanging out in the entry lounge, whether they're psetting, watching a tv show, playing a video game, having a lively debate, sharing a meal, or just chilling.

                      Hi! I’m Nina and I have a lot of feelings. My contributions to J are the 3D Printer I won at a poker tournament, the Star Wars poster in J2, and occasional stress baking. My passions lie in the happy intersection of software, hardware, and media. When I'm not here, I'm at the Media Lab where I do research, play with Legos, and occasionally make things that work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I play with The MIT Poker Club, take photos and write for The Tech, walk backwards down the Infinite as a tour guide, and do social chair things for MacGregor. I read too much Buzzfeed and laugh quite a bit (very loudly and incoherently). I'm always down for adventures in Boston, eating a lot of food, or a game of poker.

                      I'm a loyal member of the MIT Poker Club, occasional photographer and writer for The Tech, and co-social chair for MacGregor. I love movies and comic books and socializing with different humans. I read too much Buzzfeed and laugh quite a bit (very loudly). I'm always down for adventures in Boston, eating a lot of food, or a game of poker.

                    <p>
                      Home is where you come back to on your best and worst days. J Entry is home. I love the people here. We're very tight knit and truly care about each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You can always find someone in a lounge or with their door open. Whether you need help on a pset (or procrastinating), a Jenizen will be there. It's common to see us studying, eating dinner, or out in Boston together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I love the different interests in J. We have artists and chemists and rowers and biologists and programmers and mechanical engineers all living together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When I look back at my college experience, I probably won't remember that pset I dropped or that lab that didn't go well. I'll remember Theresa and Richard's drawings on my board, or getting a dish rack. I'll remember the upperclassmen who helped me my freshman year. I'll remember standing in the hall at 3am laughing with Ethan and Kevin and Ron. I'll remember coming home to a cozy lounge full of amazing people writing quotes on a whiteboard and ordering food together. The people who became my family. I'll remember J Entry.

I am course 2 with a passion for course 22 and will probably end up double majoring. I enjoy running (especially spontaneous sprint races), play the guitar from time to time, and juggle when the feeling takes me.

                      Though it has become something of a cliché, I think it is right to state that the people in J enjoy working hard and playing hard. There are always people in the lounge to have a chat and banter with; when you need some quiet, you will be able to find a place to work in peace. We have a large range of complementary personalities and lots of different interests, and I found it very easy to fit in.

                      I'm pretty regular. I did a lot of stuff at MIT - I was in a sorority, and part of Gospel Choir, E33, DanceTroupe, and MacG exec, so I was never bored. I'm a decent cook, and always down for sharing. I got introduced to Doctor Who my sophomore year and fell in love - and possibly binge watched it for the next two years. I love chocolate and our dessert study breaks. I think watching scary movies on Halloween is a must, even though I can't handle them. Apparently I make entertaining faces also. I graduated this past year and am working for Accenture as a technology consultant in the D.C. area.

                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      I had a bad dorm experience freshman year and was considering leaving MIT after a difficult year. The J entry GRT took me in and invited me to the annual senior dinner. The other residents immediately started making fun of me, so I knew I would fit in. I moved in after that and found what I was looking for in a dorm - people to be there when I was stressed or sad, to have intelligent (or non-intelligent) conversations with, to say goodnight to, to watch scary movies with, to go out to impromptu dinners with, to watch Doctor Who with, and a million other things. J entry is one of the main reasons I stayed at MIT, and I can honestly say I don't have a single bad memory of living there.

                    <p>
                      Greetings! I am Tricia, former Social Chair, Entry Chair, Supreme Overlord of Reimbursements, Keeper of the Google Docs, Crafter of Titles, and so on. My proudest achievement is the formation of J2 as my legion of underclassman trolls. I was a leader of the campaign to educate all Jenizens in the things that are important in life - namely great movies they should have seen, such as Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Back to the Future. I enjoy video games, hiking, terrible puns, Star Wars and Spongebob references, trolling Kevin, going on adventures around Boston, and probably some other things.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      It has been said before and it will be said again - the best thing about J Entry is the people. I came to MIT worried about making friends, so during REX I focused on trying to find a place where I could make friends and be happy. One night, as I was wandering through MacGregor, a Jenizen found me and brought me to J. I had fun hanging out in the lounge for a while that night with several residents, but more importantly, I found myself coming back again the next few nights. Hanging out in J was fun, and felt naturally fun, not forced like a lot of REX events, where it obviously isn't like that during the school year (AKA most of the time). I genuinely love the people in J, and I am so glad that it's where I wound up. I even became Social Chair and later Entry Chair - something I never would have seen myself getting involved in before - because of how much I liked J and wanted to make it even more awesome.

                      J Entry is a tight-knit place full of friendly, caring, fun individuals, and above all else, feels like a home. J was also just the right kind of fun for me - in a given week, you might experience an all-night p-set party in the main lounge (punctuated by our favorite YouTube videos), covering the whole end of the hallway in a web of yarn with your neighbors, a movie marathon, a spontaneous outing into Boston, or a long chain of terrible, terrible puns. The friends I have made in J are the closest I have. Alas, four years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

                      Hi! I graduated from MIT in 2009 but loved it so much I stayed for grad school (x2, MD and PhD!). I like to run, play board games, do research, and live in J-Entry as one of your GRTs!
